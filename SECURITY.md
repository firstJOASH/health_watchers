## Stellar Private Key Encryption (Issue #596)

### Overview

Clinic Stellar secret keys (starting with `S`) provide full control over a clinic's Stellar account. A single database breach without encryption would allow an attacker to drain all clinic funds.

### Implementation

Stellar secret keys are encrypted at rest using **AES-256-GCM** before storage in MongoDB. The implementation is in `apps/api/src/modules/clinics/keypair.service.ts`.

**Key separation:** The Stellar keypair encryption uses a dedicated `KEYPAIR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable — a separate 32-byte key from the PHI field encryption key (`FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`). This ensures that compromising one key does not expose both PHI and Stellar secrets.

**Storage format:**
- `encryptedSecretKey`: `<ciphertext_hex>:<auth_tag_hex>` — AES-256-GCM ciphertext with authentication tag
- `iv`: `<iv_hex>` — 16-byte random IV stored separately

**Guarantees:**
- Raw Stellar secret keys (starting with `S`) are **never** stored in MongoDB
- Each encryption uses a fresh random IV (no IV reuse)
- GCM authentication tag prevents ciphertext tampering
- Decryption failures are counted via the `mongodb_keypair_decryption_failures_total` Prometheus metric and trigger a critical alert

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `KEYPAIR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex string (32 bytes) for Stellar keypair encryption | Yes |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex string (32 bytes) for PHI field encryption | Yes |

Generate a secure key:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Key Rotation

To rotate the `KEYPAIR_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

1. Generate a new key: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Write a migration script that:
   - Reads each `ClinicKeypair` document
   - Decrypts `encryptedSecretKey` with the **old** key
   - Re-encrypts with the **new** key
   - Updates the document and increments `keyVersion`
3. Deploy the migration before updating the environment variable
4. Update `KEYPAIR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault)

### Future Improvements

- **AWS KMS / HashiCorp Vault**: For production, consider wrapping the `KEYPAIR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with a KMS-managed Key Encryption Key (KEK). This provides hardware-backed key protection and automatic key rotation.
- **Envelope encryption**: Store only the encrypted data key in the database; the master key never leaves KMS.

---

## PHI Field Encryption

Patient PHI fields (`contactNumber`, `address`, `dateOfBirth`) are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM via `apps/api/src/lib/encrypt.ts`. The encryption key is configured via `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens and rotating refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (SUPER_ADMIN, CLINIC_ADMIN, DOCTOR, NURSE, ASSISTANT, READ_ONLY)
- MFA support via TOTP

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

Security-relevant Prometheus alerts are defined in `monitoring/alerts.yml`:

- `StellarKeypairDecryptionFailure` — fires immediately on any decryption failure (critical)
- `MongoDBPoolHighUtilization` — fires when pool utilization > 80% for 2 minutes (warning)
- `MongoDBPoolWaitQueueNonEmpty` — fires when requests queue for connections (critical)
# Security Guidelines

Health Watchers is designed with HIPAA and GDPR compliance in mind. This document outlines security practices and guidelines.

3. [API Security](#api-security)
4. [Incident Response](#incident-response)
5. [Compliance](#compliance)
6. [Reporting Security Issues](#reporting-security-issues)

## Authentication & Authorization

### Password Policy

- Minimum 12 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost 12)
- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts (15 minutes)

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) available for admin roles
- Backup codes generated during MFA setup
- MFA required for SUPER_ADMIN and CLINIC_ADMIN roles

### Token Management

- Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
- Refresh token rotation: new token issued on each refresh
- Tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Token revocation on logout

### Access Token Invalidation (Redis-backed)

Access tokens are short-lived (15 min) but can be explicitly invalidated before expiry:

- **Per-token denylist**: Each access token carries a `jti` (UUID v4) claim. On logout or password change, the `jti` is stored in Redis with a TTL equal to the token's remaining lifetime. `verifyAccessToken` rejects any token whose `jti` is in the denylist.
- **Logout-all**: `POST /api/v1/auth/logout-all` stores a per-user invalidation timestamp (`user-invalidated:{userId}`) in Redis. All access tokens with an `iat` (issued-at) before that timestamp are rejected, effectively invalidating every active session for the user.
- **Graceful degradation**: If Redis is unavailable, denylist checks are skipped and tokens remain valid until natural expiry. This is acceptable given the 15-minute access token lifetime.

Redis keys used:

| Key pattern | Purpose | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| `token-denylist:{jti}` | Single-token revocation | Token's remaining lifetime |
| `user-invalidated:{userId}` | Logout-all timestamp | 7 days |

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles and permissions:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | Full system access |
| CLINIC_ADMIN | Clinic management, user management, billing |
| DOCTOR | Patient management, encounter creation, prescriptions |
| NURSE | Patient management, vital signs, basic documentation |
| ASSISTANT | Appointment scheduling, patient communication |
| READ_ONLY | View-only access to patient records |
| PATIENT | Access own records, appointments, payments |

# Health Watchers — Monitoring

This directory contains the full observability stack configuration for Health Watchers: Prometheus scrape config, alerting rules, and Grafana dashboard provisioning.

## Stack

| Service    | Port  | Purpose                          |
|------------|-------|----------------------------------|
| Prometheus | 9090  | Metrics collection & alerting    |
| Grafana    | 3003  | Dashboards & visualisation       |
| Jaeger     | 16686 | Distributed tracing (OTLP)       |

Start the full stack with:

```bash
docker compose up -d prometheus grafana jaeger
```

Grafana is available at **http://localhost:3003** (default credentials: `admin` / `admin`).

## Dashboards

All dashboards are provisioned automatically from `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`. No manual import is required. They appear in the **Health Watchers** folder inside Grafana.

## Alert Rules

Alert rules are split across four files, all loaded by Prometheus:

| File | Groups | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `alerts.yml` | `health-watchers-alerts` | Legacy combined alerts (kept for backward compatibility) |
| `alerts-payments.yml` | `payment-expiration-job`, `stellar-payments` | Payment lifecycle and Stellar service alerts |
| `alerts-security.yml` | `security` | Auth failures, rate limits, keypair issues |
| `alerts-business.yml` | `business-kpis`, `api-health`, `mongodb-health` | Business KPIs, API health, MongoDB health |

Each alert includes a `dashboard` label pointing to the relevant Grafana dashboard UID for quick navigation.

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `critical` | Immediate action required — service is down or data integrity at risk |
| `warning` | Degraded performance or elevated error rates — investigate soon |
| `info` | Informational — no immediate action required |

---

## Adding a New Dashboard

1. Create a JSON file in `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/` with a unique `uid`.
2. The dashboard provider reloads every 30 seconds — no Grafana restart needed.
3. Add corresponding alert rules to the appropriate `alerts-*.yml` file.
4. Update this README with the new dashboard's panel and metric inventory.

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboards not appearing in Grafana**  
Check that the JSON is valid and the `uid` is unique across all dashboard files. Grafana logs provisioning errors at startup.

**"No data" on panels**  
Verify the Prometheus scrape targets are healthy at http://localhost:9090/targets. Confirm the API and Stellar service are running and the `METRICS_USERNAME`/`METRICS_PASSWORD` env vars match.

**Alert rules not loading**  
Check Prometheus logs and verify the alert file paths in `prometheus.yml` match the volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`.
